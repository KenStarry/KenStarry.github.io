## Simple workflow for deploying static content to GitHub Pages
#name: Deploy static content to Pages

#on:
#  # Runs on pushes targeting the default branch
#  push:
#    branches: [ "main" ]
#
#  # Runs on PR Targeting Main
#  pull_request:

#  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

## Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
#permissions:
#  contents: read
#  pages: write

## Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
## However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.
